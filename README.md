# React Bootstrap Project - WebFriends

A site where you can hire people or manage your own projects with ease and comfort in mind. This project was part of my Web Development journey during my time in NAIT (Northern Alberta Institute of Technology). I made this project with various tools that I have learned to further showcase my skills and flexibility.

As a class, we initially did this project with only HTML and Bootstrap 4 CDN which was our last project to finish the semester.

## Tools and packages I used:

- Vite + React
- TypeScript
- Bootstrap 5
- React-Bootstrap
- react-router-dom
- react-icons
- Google Fonts (Poppins)
